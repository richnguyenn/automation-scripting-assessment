    "## 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was provided in CSV format and imported using Python's `pandas` library. Conducted a manual inspection on the dataset on Excel to verify the structure, column types, and presence of null or inconsistent values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Loading\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load data into a pandas df\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('../data/movies.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify data is loaded correctly\n",
    "## Check rows + cols exist\n",
    "num_rows, num_cols = df.shape\n",
    "print(f\"Row Count: {num_rows}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Column Count: {num_cols}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Specs\n",
    "print(df.info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loaded `movies.csv` using `pd.read_csv()`\n",
    "- Verified number of rows and columns using `.shape`\n",
    "- Inspected data structure and types using `.info()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "The preprocessing portion primarily focused on cleaning and transforming critical columns into usable types to prepare for my analysis and modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Cleaning Steps\n",
    "- **Removed rows with missing `Year`** to ensure meaningful data.\n",
    "- **Cleaned the `Year` column** using regex to extract 4-digit years and dropped any invalid or missing values.\n",
    "- **Standardized `Duration`** by extracting the integer portion from strings like \"90 min\" using regex. A flag column was added to indicate missing durations.\n",
    "- **Checked for and reported missing values** across all columns with a helper function that printed both counts and percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Function (used for cleaning `Year`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def clean_year(value):\n",
    "    if pd.isna(value):\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    match = re.search(r'\\d{4}', str(value))\n",
    "    if match:\n",
    "        return int(match.group())\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this step established a **cleaned and structured dataset**, which was saved as `movies_cleaned.csv` and used for all subsequent steps."

    "## 2. Data Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Following preprocessing, we conducted both basic and advanced analyses to extract meaningful insights from the movie dataset. This included descriptive statistics, trend identification, correlation examination, and visual storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially began with analyzing the basic metrics of the dataset, using the `describe()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Descriptive Analysis](./imgs/decriptive_analysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I continued with analyzing the frequency counts and top values for several categorical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top 10 Genres**: Highlighted the most prevalent movie genres.\n",
    "- **Top 10 Directors**: Identified the most represented directors.\n",
    "- **Top 10 Actors**: Aggregated appearances across the three actor columns.\n",
    "- **Top 10 Voted Movies**: Sorted by number of user votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these was visualized using horizontal bar plots, arranged in a multi-plot grid for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top 10s Analysis](./imgs/top_10_analysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how key numerical attributes are distributed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ratings**: Slightly right-skewed, with most movies rated between 6.0 and 7.5.\n",
    "- **Duration**: Concentrated around the 110-150 minute mark.\n",
    "- **Year**: Peaks around the 2000s–2010s, suggesting more recent movies dominate the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I visualized these using histograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distribution Analysis](./imgs/distribution_analysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I computed the Pearson correlation coefficients for numerical columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "            Rating     Votes  Duration      Year\n",
    "Rating    1.000000  0.126635 -0.031093 -0.166673\n",
    "Votes     0.126635  1.000000  0.099660  0.129016\n",
    "Duration -0.031093  0.099660  1.000000 -0.374097\n",
    "Year     -0.166673  0.129016 -0.374097  1.000000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- `Votes` has a weak positive correlation with `Rating`, indicating some relationship between popularity and perception.\n",
    "- `Year` has a slightly stronger negative correlation in comparison to the other results with `Duration`, suggesting newer movies trend shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Used line plots to track average trends over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duration over Time**: A visible decline in average runtime from early 2000s onward.\n",
    "- **Votes over Time**: Steady growth in votes, reflecting expanding audiences or platforms.\n",

    "## 3. Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore potential applications of machine learning to this dataset, I attempted to build a simple regression model to predict movie ratings using available numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "I began with a basic linear regression model using features like `Votes`, `Year`, and `Duration`. While this model was easy to interpret, the performance was poor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 1.78\n",
    "- **R^2 Score**: 0.08\n",
    "\n",
    "This low R^2 score indicated that the linear model could not effectively explain the variance in ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `log-transforming` the votes column, results improved slightly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 1.72\n",
    "- **R^2 Score**: 0.11\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve performance, I then applied a **Random Forest Regressor**, which is more flexible and can handle non-linear relationships without assuming a fixed functional form.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After log-transforming the `Votes` column, performance improved modestly.\n",
    "- The **R² score increased to approximately 0.23**, indicating slightly better predictive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result suggests that while numeric variables like `Votes`, `Duration`, and `Year` provide some signal, much of the predictive variance may likely lie in categorical data like `Genre`, `Actors`, and `Director`, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps (If More Time Were Available)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given more time, I would have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implemented One-Hot Encoding** for the `Genre` column (and possibly actors or directors) to convert them into numerical features for further modeling.\n",
    "- **Performed feature selection** or dimensionality reduction on these encoded variables.\n",
    "- **Tried gradient boosting models** like XGBoost for better performance on sparse and mixed data types."
